# Employee Management System

### Objective:

Develop a command-line Employee Management System using Python that allows a company to manage information about their employees and departments using OOP and data structures.

### Requirements:
1.	Employee Class:
    1.	Create an Employee class with attributes for name, ID, title, and department.
    2.	Include a method to display employee details.
    3.	Implement a string representation method that returns the employee's name and ID.


2.	Department Class:
    1.	Create a Department class with attributes for department name and a list of employees.
    2.	Include methods to add an employee, remove an employee, and list all employees in the department.


3.	Data Structure for Company:
    1.	Use a dictionary to represent the company, with department names as keys and Department objects as    values.
    2.	Implement functions to add a department, remove a department, and display all departments.


4.	User Interaction:
    1.	Write a function that prints a menu for the user to interact with the Employee Management System 
        (e.g., Add Employee, Remove Employee, Display Department, etc.).
    2.	The user should be able to add employees to departments, remove employees, and view department details.


5.	Data Persistence (Optional â€“ understanding the knowledge of streams):
    1.	Save the company data to a file and load it back into the system on startup. (This can be plain text,JSON, or any other format you deem appropriate.)


### Instructions:
1.	Structure your code with appropriate classes and functions.
2.	Ensure your classes use proper encapsulation for attributes.
3.	Include error handling for cases such as adding an employee to a non-existent department.
4.	Write clear instructions for the user on how to use the command-line interface.
5.	Comment your code to explain your logic and design decisions.
6.	(Optional) Include unit tests to validate your methods.


### Deliverables:
1.	Python script(s) (.py files) that run the Employee Management System.
2.	(Optional) A text or JSON file containing the company data.
3.	(Optional) A test script with unit tests.


### Evaluation Criteria:
1.	Correct implementation of OOP principles.
2.	Efficient use of data structures.
3.	Code readability and comments.
4.	Error handling and edge case consideration.
5.	Unit tests (Optional) and testing strategy.
